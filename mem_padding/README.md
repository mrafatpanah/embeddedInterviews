# Embedded Interview Series:
## Memory Padding and Alignment in C

As I continue my series on embedded systems interview topics, today I want to address another common question that tests your understanding of low-level memory management.

### Memory Optimization Through Member Reordering
By simply reordering the structure members, we can significantly reduce memory usage

### Why This Matters:
In embedded systems with limited resources, every byte counts. Proper structure organization can:
- Reduce RAM usage
- Improve cache efficiency
- Allow more data to fit in limited memory
For frequently instantiated structures or arrays of structures, these savings multiply and can make the difference between fitting your application in available memory or not.

### Memory Alignment Rules to Remember:
- Group variables by size (largest to smallest)
- Arrange structures so members align naturally
- Remember that arrays are always contiguous
- Consider the alignment requirements of the target processor
